# ZoÃ«2 Interfaces
Package with shared messages, services, and actions for inter-package communication. 


## Notice - This package is currently unused
Custom drive messages and services have been phased out in favor of standard twist commands published to the `/cmd_vel` topic. This package is therefore deprecated until future custom interfaces as needed. The structure has been preserved for future expansion.

When we start using this package again, make sure to delete the `COLCON_IGNORE` file so that it builds!
